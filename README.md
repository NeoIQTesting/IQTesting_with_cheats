# IQTesting_with_cheats
This is a silly Android app that tests your IQ by scanning your fingerprint (Actually just by long-pressing a button). A cheating mode is added in this variant of the app. </br>
In order to enter the cheating mode, just long-press the button at the bottom of the screen. Under cheating mode, the result will between 190 and 210. Otherwise it will be no more than 100. </br>
This silly app is just for fun. Never mind the results! Nobody is responsible to any consequences that are caused by using this app.
